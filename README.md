# Assignments 
# **Assignment 1: ATM Machine Using OOPs in java**  

## **Objective**  
Implement an ATM machine simulation using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** in Java. The program should provide users with four options:  

1. **Check Current Balance** – Displays the current balance of user.  
2. **Deposit Money** – Allows the user to enter an amount to add to their balance.  
3. **Withdraw Money** – Allows the user to enter an amount to deduct from their balance (ensure sufficient funds).  
4. **Exit** – Stops the program.  

After performing an operation, the user should be presented with the same options again until they choose to exit.  
# **Assignment 2: Employee Management System: using abstract class** 

1. Create an abstract class Employee with the fiels like name, id, and an abstract method calculateSalary().
2. Derive two concrete classes FullTimeEmp and PartTimeEmpl that implement calculateSalary() differently.
3. Demonstrate polymorphism by creating instances of both classes and calling calculateSalary().

# **Assignment 2: Multiple Inheritance using Interfaces:**
1. Create an interface Flyable with method fly().
2. Create another interface Swimmable with method swim().
3. Create a class Amphibian that implements both interfaces and provides implementations for fly() and swim().
